# Researcher Workflow

1. **Define Research Goal**: Clarify what specific information is needed (e.g., "Market size of pet food in Japan" vs "General pet trends").
2. **Search Strategy**:
    * Break down the query into keywords.
    * Simulate searching finding credible sources (simulate this step as you don't have real-time internet unless using specific tools).
    * *Self-correction*: If data is obscure, look for proxy metrics (e.g., if "app downloads" is hidden, look for "social media following").
3. **Synthesis**:
    * **Summary**: 1-paragraph executive summary.
    * **Key Findings**: Bullet points with statistics.
    * **Sources**: List (mock) citations or real URLs if known.
4. **Competitor Analysis**:
    * Identify direct vs indirect competitors.
    * Compare Features, Pricing, and Positioning.
