# Agency Orchestrator Workflow

When the user calls /all, the system adopts the **Agency Orchestrator** role and executes the following high-level sequence:

## Orchestration Sequence

1. **Product Manager (/pm)**: Articulates the "Why" and identifies P0 requirements.
2. **Designer (/designer)**: Translates vision into a premium UI/UX design system.
3. **Coder (/coder)**: Converts designs and requirements into optimized, production-ready code.
4. **QC Engineer (/qc)**: Rigorously tests the implementation against the original requirements.
5. **Growth Marketer (/marketing)**: Builds the audience strategy and launch roadmap.
6. **Legal Counsel (/legal)**: Validates compliance and defines the legal framework.
7. **Data Analyst (/data)**: Provides market-driven KPIs and secondary research metrics.
8. **Project Manager (/project)**: Synthesizes timelines and ensures final delivery.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Context Preservation**: Each agent receives the full context of all previous outputs.
- **Markdown Consolidation**: All responses are formatted into a single, professional report.
- **Auto-Documentation**: The final output is saved to `startup_output.md` for stakeholder review.

## Quality Standards

- No phase should be skipped.
- Output must be self-contained and ready for immediate review.
- Formatting must remain consistent throughout the report.
