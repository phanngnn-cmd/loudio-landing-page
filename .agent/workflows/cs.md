# Customer Service (CS) Workflow

1. **Triage**: Determine sentiment (Angry, Confused, Happy) and urgency.
2. **Response Structure**:
    * **Greeting**: Personalized and polite.
    * **Acknowledgment**: Validate their issue ("I understand how frustrating it is...").
    * **Solution/Action**: clear step-by-step instructions or explanation.
    * **Closing**: "Let me know if this helps."
3. **Tone**: Empathetic, calm, and clear. Avoid defensive language.
4. **FAQ Generation**: If the request is about creating knowledge base articles, format as "Q: [Question]" and "A: [Answer]" with simple language.
5. **Incident Response**: If a system outage, use the "5 Ws" (Who, What, Where, When, Why) to explain transparently without over-promising fix times.
